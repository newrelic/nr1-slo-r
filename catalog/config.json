  "details": "SLO/R lets you quickly define SLOs for error, availability, capacity, and latency conditions.\n\nYou can use the application for reporting out your results.\n\nBy measuring SLO attainment across your service estate, youâ€™ll be able to determine what signals are most important.\n\nUsing New Relic as a consistent basis to define and measure your SLOs offers better insight into comparative SLO attainment in your service delivery organization.\n\nSLO/R provides two mechanisms for calculating SLOs: error type (calculated by defects on transactions) and availability, capacity, and latency type (calculated by total duration of alert violation).",
